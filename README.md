Consumable Drugs, Drugs such as weed, coke, lean and meth can be used/consumed. For example weed can be used by running the command /drugs-weed 1.However the commands will not work if the player is not near a drug prop that corresponds with the drug they are attempting to use (This is only for weed and coke atm) All drugs apart from weed also have the possibility for overdosing. You will over dose from Cocaine if you take 2 grams or over at once, Lean can kill you if you overdose (1.5 L at once)
and you can overdose from meth if you take 3 or more syringes at once.
